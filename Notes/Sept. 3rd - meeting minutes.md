KiCad Workshop + Soldering Competition


**Design Characteristics**
**Objectives & Constraints**

Upgradeability
- coding style - Daniel
	- coding standards - code should not be shit

**Goal is component selection**

Hardware
- Prebuilt Modules - Daniel
	- for testing?
- think about through-hole VS SMD components
- Shape - Daniel, everyone next week
	- competition constraints - not higher than the wall..
	- full-size, or half-size?
	- Symmetry is good :)
- Reducing Noise - reduce noise from sensors everywhere - Jacqueline
	- Suspension
	- Dampers
	- How else?
- Sensors - Jacqueline, Aryan
	- IR, time of flight, ultrasonic
	- Detect walls ?
	- Measure revolutions - encoders
	- Acceleration / orientation - IMU
	- Power Regulation
	- Anything else to detect...?
- Movement - Jacqueline, Aidan
	- How many wheels 
		- think about friction, motors, power, weight, control....
		- single wheel
			- hamster ball design
	- what wheels should we get 
		- type of wheel
		- material
	- What type of motors ?
		- Gears / no gears?
		- Drive trains
		- External mounts...
		- Gear boxes prebuilt/not?
	- How many?
	- Steering - what is best for micromouse design
		- Axles?
		- Transmission?
		- Differential Steering?
- How to physically test mouse? - Raghav
	- Build maze?
	- Storage / testing area like McCaul or somewhere?
	- Test materials
		- Absorbent ? Reflective ? ???
		- Friction?
- Power
	- Battery
		- Type of batteries - Oliver, Daisy
			- Lithium Ion - Lithium Polymer - Sodium Ion - maybe smth else...
			- What is the best weight / size ?
			- Voltage required - max / min currents?
			- Current required by system - max / min currents?
			- Shape
			- Mounting batteries
		- Power Regulation - Oliver, Daisy, Raghav
			- how do we meet our min / max requirements and maintain stable values?
			- components?
			- Voltage / Current protection
			- Polarity !
- Microcontrollers - Raghav, Daniel
	- Stm32, Esp32.. which is better?
		- what version / how many pins would we need?
	- free microcontroller...... possibly
